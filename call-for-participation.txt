FOSDEM'16 HPC, Big Data, and Data Science Devroom Call for Participation

Sunday, January 31, 2016, Brussels, Belgium

# Overview

We are proud to announce the 1st edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science
devroom, co-located with FOSDEM 2016. FOSDEM is an annual conference about free
and open source software, attended by over 5000 developers and open-source
enthusiasts from all over the world. FOSDEM has hosted an HPC devroom before,
but this is the first time that representatives from the HPC and Big Data
communities are joining forces to bring both communities together with this
devroom.

    High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data are two important approaches
    to scientific computing. HPC typically deals with smaller, highly structured
    data sets and huge amounts of computation while Big Data, not surprisingly,
    deals with gigantic, unstructured data sets and focuses on the I/O
    bottlenecks. With the Big Data trend unlocking access to an unprecedented
    amount of data, Data Science has emerged to tackle the problem of creating
    processes and approaches to extracting knowledge or insights from these data
    sets. Machine learning and predictive analytics algorithms have joined the
    family of more traditional HPC algorithms and are pushing the requirements
    of cluster and data scalability.

    Free and Open Source communities have been the foundation of the HPC and Big
    Data communities for some time. In the HPC community, it should be no
    surprise that 488 of the Top500 supercomputers in the world run Linux. On
    the Big Data side, the Hadoop ecosystem has had a tremendous amount of Open
    Source contributions from a wide range of organizations coming together
    under the Apache Software Foundation.

    Our goal is to bring the communities together, share expertise, learn how we
    can benefit from each other’s work and foster further joint research and
    collaboration. We welcome talks about Free and Open Source solutions to the
    challenges presented by large scale computing, data management and data
    analysis.

The devroom will take place on Sunday, January 31st 2016, at ULB (Campus
Solbosch), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to enjoy a full day of talks, demos and
interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.

Sounds interesting? Submit your talk proposal below and see you in Brussels!

    Experiences reports on using Big Data systems, for example:
        Large-scale deployments
        Development and configuration issues
        Tuning and performance tips and lessons learned
    Interesting Big Data use-cases and applications

    Comparative analysis of existing systems, evaluation results, performance
    studies

    Interdisciplinary HPC/Big Data use-cases, for example:
        Applications using both HPC and Big Data technologies
        Integration issues
        Open research problems on the convergence of HPC and Big Data
        Running MPI jobs on Big Data clusters and vice-versa

# Submission

We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data
Science communities. Talks proposals should be submitted through the FOSDEM
Pentabarf server. Submissions must include:

    Abstract
    Session type
    Session length
    Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
    Speaker bio
    Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
    Links to previous talks by the speaker

Our intention is to have a full day of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an
additional 5 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note:

    Talks will be streamed live and will be recorded. By submitting a session,
    speakers agree to being recorded and having their talk made available.

    All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software. We
    highly discourage “marketing” talks.

Submit here: <https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16>

When submitting your talk in Pentabarf, make sure to select the ‘HPC, Big Data,
and Data Science Devroom’ as the ‘Track’.

If you already have a Pentabarf account from a previous FOSDEM edition, please
reuse it. Create an account if, and only if, you don’t have one from a previous
year. If you have any issues with Pentabarf, do not despair: contact
